.title ES BBS   +90-222-2345869
ES BBS is located in Eskisehir/Turkiye and provides its' users a huge
archive of Aviation and Aircrafts files as well as other misc stuff. The
BBS has messaging ability across HiTNeT, PeaceNet and TurkNet. The
author Sedat Kapanoglu is the CoSysOp of ES BBS.
.end

.topic Filters
Filters are "message processors". Each time you write a message,
filters that you selected "process" the message. This processing can
be anything such as appending your signature each message you wrote,
spell checking and correcting, translating the character set etc. To use
filters, all you have to do is to activate the filters you want to use
from "Settings". All these filters are external programs and they're
located on FLT\ directory.

There are some sample filters in Wolverine packet. You may also find
more filters in {ES BBS:esbbs} file areas.

{Everyone can write filters!:filterdk}
.end

.topic filterdk
A filter gets two parameters from command-line. First parameter is the source
file which contains the original "raw" message. Second parameter is the
name of the output file which the filter should use it to write its processed
data to.

To gain speed, the filter may manipulate the source file directly. This
method is also compatible with Wolverine 1.x versions. On the other hand
using two separate files is more efficient and easier to code.

To see how a filter looks like, take a look at sample filters which
are located in FLT\.

Since a filters' name cannot exceed 8 characters (DOS limit), to make
your filter more descriptive *.FLT files exist. Its format is simple
as hell:

 Desc = Filter description
 Author = Author of the filter
 Files = Files used by the filter (names are separated with semicolon)

Wolverine will find this extra information and use it automatically.

In the "Files" line, you may use wildcards. Such a filter-info file
looks like this: (F_SPELL.FLT)

 Desc = Anna's Spell checker
 Author = Anna Falchi
 Files = F_SPELL.* ; DICT.INI ; FILE_ID.DIZ

.end

.topic global
The "global menu" is the window which is located on the top-left of
the screen. It has some buttons in it. All that simple.

So what does make this menu special? You may add your applications
in this menu too (which is only available for
{registered users:registration}). Here is the method to use this
advantage:

There is a file called W.MNU in the Wolverine's main directory. You add
your applications in this file. The method of doing this is described
in the W.MNU file.

The applications which you've added are shown with their name and a
number. Hold-down the Alt-key and the number of the application if you
want to run the application in a short way.
.end

.topic DESQview
Since DESQview is becoming history day by day, I
couldn't have a chance to try Wolverine under it so I beg your REPORTS!
However, Wolverine supports time sharing features of DESQview.

.end

.topic cmdline
Wolverine command-line parameters:

 -?
Shows an help screen which looks like this.

 -cd:n
If more than one CD-ROM drive are attached to your system, Wolverine
uses the first as default. You can override this behaviour with
this parameter. Give the NUMBER of the CD-ROM drive you want to use
to play audio. The drive number is based on zero which makes your
first drive 0, second drive 1 etc.

 -cfg:nn
Uses nn.CFG file as the configuration file and nn.KEY as the
registration key. Say, you run wolverine with parameter -cfg:hebe. Then
Wolverine uses HEBE.CFG as the configuration file and HEBE.KEY as
registration key file. Since unregistered users don't have any key file
Wolverine ignores this setting for keyfiles in such a state. Note for
registered users: Your keyfile is called W.KEY. When you use -CFG
parameter, don't forget to rename your keyfile to the appropriate name.

 -fast
Ones running Wolverine under a very slooow system may use this option to
turn off some nice (but time consuming) effects such as window zooming.

 -flush
In normal conditions you wouldn't need to use this option. If you have a
disk cache and your system hangs often (because of your system
configuration), and you cry for your lost data, then it's time to use
this option. This parameter forces Wolverine to flush buffers of any
disk cache loaded resident in memory. NOTE: This parameter IS NOT for a
possible bug in Wolverine which might cause lock-ups etc. This parameter
is just provided you to overcome problem caused by your system
configuration or some software running in memory anyhow. So don't think what
you're thinking.

 -lan:nn
(should be pronounced in a BOLD and LOUD voice:) Activates Wolverine's
multiple language support features and maximizes the power generator while
overloading energy accumulators. (back to normal voice) Uses nn.LAN as the
language file and nn.HLP as the help file.

 -newcfg
Deletes current configuration file and creates a new one from scratch.

 -newest
Opens newest mail packet on startup.

 -nocd
Hides the CD player.

 -nocycle
When opening a packet some green lines appear on screen. These are used
to inform the user that Wolverine is still running in a stable state. If
that annoys you, use this option and it all shall go.

 -relax
If you're running under a multitasking environment and Wolverine runs
VERY slow, (see also: crawling) you may use this option to get Wolverine
a bit faster. This option exactly turns off time-sharing features.

.end

.topic DOS
Since Wolverine is a DOS based program, it runs best under DOS. To get
maximum performance, you may use a disk cache.
.end

.topic Windows
Wolverine has been EXTREMELY tested under Win95 and no serious
problem was encountered. A minor detail is, Win95 wrongly assumes
that Wolverine is a TSR program and shouldn't be closed after it's been
quit. To overcome that problem, check the "close on exit" checkbox in
the "properties" menu of your shortcut to Wolverine.

However, Wolverine hasn't been tested that much under Win3.x. But it's
expected that there won't be any problems. REPORT BUGS NOW!!
.end

.topic os2
Although Wolverine supports all the timesharing features of OS/2, some
minor adjustments may make it better:

Here are the ideal OS/2 settings with the contributions of Hakan Koseoglu:

 DOS_BACKGROUND_EXECUTION = OFF
 DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT = 4096
 EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT = (minimum)
 HW_TIMER = OFF
 IDLE_SECONDS = 0
 IDLE_SENSITIVITY = 2
 INT_DURING_IO = OFF
 SESSION_PRIORITY = 1
 XMS_MEMORY_LIMIT = (minimum)

.end

.topic keymask

 Keys:

 F1:
Shows an explanatory screen on what you are doing.

 The rightmost '+' key:
Allows you to travel between windows. (Like Alt-Tab in Windows)

 The rightmost '-' key:
Allows you to switch between two windows. Hard to use. I even don't
remember however I did it.

 Alt-F4:
Closes active window.

 F5:
Maximizes the window. If it's already been maximized then restores its
position and size.

 Ctrl-F5:
Allows you to move the window with keyboard.

 Ctrl-F6:
Allows you to resize the window.

 Esc:
Mostly closes the active window. If it doesn't then try Alt-F4.

 Alt-D:
Jumps into nearest dos prompt. To go back just type 'EXIT' and press
enter. (Do I have to say these? *cry*)

 Alt-X:
Allows you to quit Wolverine. Before you quit all your files are saved
automatically or asked for anyway.

 F12:
Emergency exit! Authorized personnel only. Does not save any unsaved
information and does not ASKS you to do it. So beware of it!

.note sdDLDir
.title Mail packets
You should write where your mail packets are located (commonly the
download path of your favorite terminal program). If you don't,
Wolverine will never be able to find where your mail packets are
located.
.end

.note sdULDir
.title Reply packets
Directory where your reply packets will be located. In most cases, the
upload directory of your terminal program is used but that's not
necessary. (unless your terminal program doesn't support uploads from
other directories than its own)
.end

.note sdEditCmd
.title Editor command
Specifies the program you use for editing files. EDIT, Q, A are such
these programs.
.end

.note sdFilterCmd
.title Filter command
You specify the filters you use here. You may use the button nearby this
line for a point & shoot filter selector. Or you may manually type the
filter names here separated by the plus sign.
.end

.note sdQuoteStr
.title Quote string
When you reply a message, a quote string is automatically added to the
beginning of your message which contains the info about the original
message (such as the Sender, receiver, message date etc), since you
quote that message and the person you send the message may wonder which
message you're talking about so this line is used for that. Here you
specify the form of your quote line:

 @F: "From" field of the quoted message.
   @F1: first name...
   @F2: last name...
 @T: "To" field of the quoted message.
   @T1: first name...
   @T2: last name...
 @S: Subject of the quoted message.
 @D: Date and time of the quoted message.
   @D1: only date...
   @D2: only time...
 @M: Gets to the next line. (used for multiple line quotes)

.end

.note sdPassword
.title Password
This password is asked you each time you run Wolverine. Since this field
is blank normally, no password is asked. If you enter here something,
REMEMBER what you've entered otherwise you won't be able to run
Wolverine. (in such cases, you can delete the configuration file to run
Wolverine). To remove the password just remove the contents of that
field.
.end

.note sdAreaSort
.title Sort message areas
Sorts the message areas in alphabetical order. Message areas are sorted
in the order of BBS default and that kind of sorting may confuse someone
who is looking for a specific area. So leave that option checked.
.end

.note sdFallenAngel
.title Use FallenAngel feature
FallenAngel feature allows the mouse pointer to vanish automatically
when it determines that the user doesn't need it anymore.
.end

.note sdAskPost
.title Ask before posting message
Each time you write a message, you can be asked should Wolverine post
your message or just delete it. Not a useful option I think but it's
there. For you. Yeah.
.end

.note sdPersBeep
.title Beep on personal messages
Each time you encounter a personal message, performs a nice and short
musical melody (!) if this option is turned on.
.end

.note sdReplySafe
.title Protect my replies!
The ReplySafe(TM) mechanism in Wolverine protects your replies in THE
SAFEST WAY. Each time you write a message all your messages are
repacked.
.end

.note sdSortTaglines
.title Sort my taglines
If alphabetically sorted taglines irritate you then turn this option
off. Are you happy now?
.end

.note sdAutoPers
.title Automatic personal scan
Looks for your personal messages each time you open a packet.
.end

.note sdNoVivaLaSewage
.title Viva la quotes!
Wolverine's "Viva la sewage" (TM) feature, prevents the user (commonly
YOU) from quoting large chunks of mail and write a couple lines under
it. If "text" / "quote" ratio exceeds %80 then a warning is shown and
you won't be able to send your mail.
.end

.note sdUnreadReminder
.title Remind unread messages
Each time you close a mail packet, Wolverine scans for the messages you
didn't read and prompts you if it finds any.
.end

.note sdTaglineUsage
.title Tagline usage
Specifies tagline usage. If you select "don't use" option, no taglines
are appended to your messages. If you select "Ask each time", you'll be
prompted to choos a tagline after you write a message. "Put always"
option will make Wolverine choose a random tagline (appropriate for the
area you're writing; see: {tagline categories:taglinecategories}) for
your message.
.end

.topic AreaListWindow

Here is the place where areas are listed. Areas are used to classify
messages by their content. In an area, subjects which are not concerning
that area are off-topic. Local areas exist only in the BBS you're
connected. Echo areas connected to other BBS's and each message you send
in an echo area is sent to other BBS's. Netmail areas are used to
send private messages which no one except the person you send the
message can read them.

Area listings are separated into two parts. Initially you see areas
that contain messages. With cursor keys or the buttons at the top of the
window, you can switch to the listing of empty areas.

.topic Benefits
Benefits of being a registered user:

1) You feel yourself light. Also with an extra bonus of knowing that the
programmer surely feels even lighter, you feel lighter than ever.

2) The "registration-begging" features of Wolverine will be WORKING!

3) You give programmers eminence! Each cents you pay will emphasize the
image of a programmer. While our respectfullness is growing, your wallet
will be deflating. Don't yield!

4) You automatically register to ALL minor versions. If you register to
v2.30 then you are a registered user of 2.x (x is whatever). When you're
upgrading to a major version (such as 2.x to 3.x) you have the
opportunity to upgrade for just $5!

5) You are not affected by price increases! (until a major version
change)
.end

.topic Registration
Three steps of registration:

1. Deposit (or find a way to deposit) $20 to my bank account
4400.2277977 in "Turkiye Is Bankasi". Fax the receipt to
+90-222-2201201.

2. Fill in the registration form in W.REG file and send it to one of my

time in two ways:

1. You may specify the exact time that the clock should warn you at.

2. You may type how many minutes should the clock wait before warning
you.

For example, if you want the clock warn you at 03:05, then type
03:05 here. But if you want to be warned after 10 minutes then just type
10.

.topic FileViewOpenDialog
"Viewer" is a feature that allows you to view any TEXT or ANSI file. Now
here you should select the file you want to view.
.end

.topic NoDLAreaWarn
If you don't download the messages in an area, then writing to that area
is meaningless since you can't receive the messages sent to you in that
area. But if you know what you're doing then go on. Otherwise you
shouldn't send the message or you may enable the area for downloading if
you're working with mail packets that have QWK support.
.end

.topic NoOLCSupport
The packet which is currently open has no off-lince area configuration
support. (such as QWK). To perform area configurations you need to
connect to  your BBS and use your BBS' configuration menus. Good luck.
.end

.topic ReplyPacketConflict
If multiple persons write to same reply packet, the BBS system will not
recognize these messages and it will assume that these message belong to
one person. You have to use different "reply packet" directories and
probably the -cfg option of Wolverine to overcome this problem.

See: {Detailed examples:multiuserexamples}
.end

.topic multiuserexamples
Say you have a brother and you're brother intended to get into this net
thing. May your brother's name be John. Create a batch file named
JOHN.BAT which contains the following lines:

@w -cfg:john

Then create a reply packet directory for John. (tip: "JOHN"). Then run
Wolverine from JOHN.BAT. Adjust the settings and don't forget to set
John's "reply packets" directory to the directory you've just created.

May you live happily forever.
.end

.topic SaveMsgInvalidName
The files are saved to the TXT\ subdirectory of Wolverine. So just type
the name of file here.

.topic ColorConfigDialog
Luke, you don't need help now. Feel the force inside. Trust the force.
May the force be with you.
.end

.topic ArchiverSetupDialog
Mail packets that you've downloaded are in a compressed format. To
uncompress these packets and also compress your reply packets, Wolverine
needs external compression/decompression programs. You probably won't
need to  adjust these settings since they're the most common ones.
.end

.topic FilterLookup
Here you select the filters you want to use for your messages. The
listing on the left shows the filters you selected and the one on the
right shows available filters. If you have unpacked a new filter but
just don't know how to install it, you may use the "Install" feature
here.
.end

.topic VivaLaSewage
When you reply a message, you quote the message to make replying easier.
But most of the novice users don't know how to delete unnecessary quote
lines and leave them as they were. Sometimes this may even cause a
message which is 218 lines long and only one line is belong to the
sender is sent to all the network. An unfortunate loss especially for
amateur networks. You may disable this check if you're a registered user
of Wolverine.
.end

.topic SearchDialog
Here you enter keyword information about the message you're looking for.
You may enter keywords in all fields at the same time and Wolverine will
use "AND" conjugation to combine these keywords. For example if you
enter "bill" in the "From" field, and enter "kahn" in the "To"
field, and enter "offer" in the "Subject" field then Wolverine would find
the  message from "Bill Gates" to "Philippe Kahn" about "Offer on Pascal
development".
.end

.topic TaglineImportHelp
With import function you may transfer taglines in a plain text file into
Wolverine for your personal usage. That's all.
.end

.topic CategoryAdd
You specify the name of the tagline category here.
(see also: {what are tagline categories:taglinecategories})
.end

.topic CategoryEdit
Here you may change the name of the tagline category. What would you
want more?
.end

.topic TaglineCategories
Tagline categories allow you to categorize your taglines :)) This kind
of classification serve two purposes: First is to make finding a tagline
easier and allow a huge capacity of taglines while not giving a bit from
useability and the second is to make "automatic tagline assignment"
SMARTER! What does that mean? That means, when you write a message, if
the area you're currently writing contains the name of one of the
tagline categories, then it uses that category to assign a random
tagline to that message. (Note that you must use "Put always" option in
tagline usage).
.end

.topic FilterInstall
You use filter installation procedure if you're not familiar with
command-line. This option copies the necessary files of a filter for
you.

NOT: To install a filter, the filter itself must have a .FLT file inside
its packet and the packet must be unpacked to a temp directory. (this
may not be necessary in the future. but you are in present time now :)

.end
