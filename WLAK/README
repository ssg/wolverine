PREFACE
~~~~~~~
Most net users can't understand the "off-line reading" concept at the
beginning (such as myself) because of the lack of documentation about
that. Besides if the off-line reader which the user intends to
use is a bit complicated then the user has no option other than
crying to the walls.

What does make an OLR complicated? The most important factor that
determines the success level of interaction between the user and OLR is
LANGUAGE! If you can't understand a program, you can't do anything.

So, Wolverine as an OLR intends to be user-friendly, overcomes this
problem with its multilingual support. Since the author himself can't
develop much variety of languages, he introduces you all the language
resources of Wolverine and compilers for it to make everything easier.

LEGAL STUFF
~~~~~~~~~~~
This kit is provided as public domain. The author shall not be liable
for anything. Also excuse my lame English.

HOW TO USE THE KIT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Help and language sources are in ASCII format so that you can easily
change them with a text editor (as I did).

Each language has three components:

  1) Help file (*.TXT which becomes *.HLP after compilation)

  2) Language file (*.LNG which becomes *.LAN after compilation)

  3) Install language file (I_*.LNG which becomes I_*.LAN after compilation)

In the sample resources the format explained clearly. (the level of
clearance varies :) Comparison between English and Turkish files may be
helpful.

MAKELAN.BAT is provided to build help and language files easier.

Note: If you're creating language files for your personal use, the
install language file does not need to be touched. (since it can't be
put into install pack)

SO
~~
If you'd like to share your PERSONALIZED language with others, you may
send it to me. It will be probably included in the next release.
