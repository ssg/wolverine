Wolverine is a GUI-based off-line mail reader for FidoNet-style networks. It's very similar to BlueWave. It supports BlueWave & QWK formats. It's not been developed for almost 15 years now but I'm providing the source code to help the community.

It's based on FatalVision which can be found at github.com/ssg/fatalvision

To see how it works you can try out a working version on DosBox at http://www.sourtimes.org/stuff/hitnet.zip
