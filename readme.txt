Wolverine is a GUI-based off-line mail reader for FidoNet-style networks, similar to BlueWave. It supports BlueWave & QWK formats. It's not been developed for almost 15 years now but I'm providing the source code to help the community.

It's based on FatalVision whose sources can be found at github.com/ssg/fatalvision
